# Minecraft-Mods-Updater
This is a super quick attempt at a bash script for a linux minecraft server to get the latest version of your mods automatically.

This is based off of [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/7rwjma/autoupdate_most_of_your_mods_with_this_shell/) and work by u/arfink.

I could not find other solutions to this at the time, when running a Minecraft server in something like Ubuntu Server, where there is no GUI to work with.

[PacMC](https://github.com/jakobkmar/pacmc?tab=readme-ov-file) looked like a very nice alternative, but unfortunately it is not yet supported on Ubuntu natively (As of 2024-04-19).
